# Magic 8 Ball


### A simple nodejs application that mimics a Magic 8 ball.

Uses [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to serve a static html page.

The ball is drawn with css and the animation is also done using css.

Note: this project also contains a Dockerfile (because why not).

## To Run

### 1. Install Nodejs

Install nodejs using the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#installing-node-js-via-package-manager).

### 2. Install dependencies (express.js)

The project contains a **package.json** file that has the dependency declared. The only thing to do is run:


```
username$ npm install

```
Info about **package.json** can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json).

### 3. Run


```
username$ node server.jsl

```
You should see a message that states: "Magic happens on port 8080". That means the server is running and you can access it at:
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)!


### To get a prediction hover your mouse over the ball!

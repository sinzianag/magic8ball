# Magic 8 Ball

A simple nodejs application that mimics a Magic 8 ball.
Uses [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to serve a static html page.
The ball is drawn with css and the animation is also done using css.
Note: this project also contains a Dockerfile (because why not).

### To get a prediction hover your mouse over the ball!
